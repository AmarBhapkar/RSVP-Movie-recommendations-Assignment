# RSVP-Movie-recommendations-Assignment

**Problem Statment:**

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

 
The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project.

**Objective:**

The SQL file contains a series of queries designed to analyze and extract insights from a movie database (IMDB). These queries aim to explore various aspects of the movie industry, including production trends, genre popularity, actor and director performance, and movie ratings.

**Summary:**

1.The file begins with basic exploratory queries to understand the database structure and identify null values in tables.

2.It then progresses to more complex analyses, including:

* Yearly and monthly movie release trends

* Genre analysis (popularity, movie counts, average durations)

* Production company performance

* Actor and director rankings based on movie ratings

* Country-specific movie statistics


3.Advanced SQL techniques used include:

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

* Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER)

* Subqueries

* CASE statements for data categorization

* Complex JOINs across multiple tables


4.The queries cover a wide range of business questions, such as:

* Identifying top-performing movies, actors, and directors

* Analyzing movie performance by genre and country

* Examining correlations between ratings and other factors (e.g., votes, production companies)
